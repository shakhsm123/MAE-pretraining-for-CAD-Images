# MAE-pretraining-for-CAD-Images
This is a repository containing two model designs for Masked Autoencoder Pretraining strategy: for Guided Masking and for Regular Random Masking of the Vessels in the CAD image.  It contains 3 Jupyter Notebooks with codes of models, and Frangi Filter based image processing for guided masking, implementations are both on PyTorch and numpy arrays.
